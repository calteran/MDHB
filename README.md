# My Digital Home Binder

This is a personal project I am developing to (partially) replace the paper binder
many people use to describe the amenities and procedures for guests in their home.

The goal is to create a single, easy-to-use, easy-to-update, and easy-to-share
document for guests & hosts alike.

Current status: **in development**
